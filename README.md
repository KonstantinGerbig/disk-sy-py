## About

The python script *disk-sy-py* simulates a population of protoplanetary disks, i.e. their dust and planetesimal content. The disk evolution model is based on [Gerbig, Lenz, & Klahr, A&A (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...629A.116G/abstract). Here, a local evolution equations are integrated radially to approximate a global evolution thus significantly reducing computational time.

*disk-sy-py* is currently work in progress and will contain several improvements compared to the code used in [Gerbig, Lenz, & Klahr, A&A (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...629A.116G/abstract) as well as signficantly more physics.
